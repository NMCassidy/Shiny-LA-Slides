Hovering over a bar will show the value for that area, and you can zoom in by dragging over an area on the plot.
Click the *Download Plot* button to save any graph.

**Data Sourcing**
Additional Data can be sourced using the *data sourcing* script. This will be necessary once more timely data is available.
